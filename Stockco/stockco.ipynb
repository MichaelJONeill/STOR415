    "Stockco is considering four investments. Each investment will yield a net present value (NPV) and require a certain cash outflow at the present time. This data is summarized in the table:\n",
    "|**Investment** | **NPV** | **Cash Outflow**|\n",
    "|----|----|----|\n",
    "|1 | $16000 | $5000 |\n",
    "|2 | $22000 | $7000 |\n",
    "|3 | $12000 | $4000 |\n",
    "| 4 | $8000 | $3000 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Stockco has a total of $14000 to invest. Assume that we cannot invest fractionally in any of these investments. How does Stockco maximize the total NPV?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the above data, Stockco has to following restrictions on its investments:\n",
    "- Stockco can invest in at most two investments.\n",
    "- If Stockco invests in investment 2, they must also invest in investment 1.\n",
    "- If Stockco invests in investment 4, they cannot invest in investment 1.\n",
